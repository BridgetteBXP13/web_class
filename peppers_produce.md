## Our Roots
Peppy's produce is a family farm company founded by Peppy Williams in 1985. He started as a simple store clerk and saved all he had in order to purchase the land for Peppy's Farm. It has been passed down for generations and we have kept the William's family legacy in Peppy's Produce. All of our produce sold is grown right on Peppy's Farm as it has been for decades. The crops and produce is free of any contaiminants as we only use organic fertilizers and pestisides. You can confidently purchase your produce knowing where they come from and support the Williams family.
